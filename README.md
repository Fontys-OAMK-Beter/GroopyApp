## Contributing
When you work on a feature remember to update the project board and make sure the field is made into an issue that is properly linked to its branch

Branch names should include issue number and the name should be made to be short and descriptive eg. '4-navbar'

When coding WRITE COMMENTS and keep these loosely in mind: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react

Once your feature is ready create a pull request and ask for someone to review it. Pull request description should contain a short description of what has been done to complete the feature

When reviewing a pull request you should go to the branch and make sure it works as intended, look at how the code is written and see if there are problems in it, such as lack of comments, style issues or potential bugs
